### Version Control Systems 

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps **record changes** to files by keeping track of modifications done to the file. 

Version control systems provides a framework for *external documentation*, where each commit documents what changes were made from previous versions of code. In addition, it provides documentation, such as README files within the project folder. 

Version control contributes to *change management* as data is not lost when personnel leave the project and new recruits that are hired will have documentation about what has already happened. 

When a project is ready for publishing, the version control system can also package the current project and release it. Release schedules vary depending on the project and organization structures. For example, Microsoft does their updates on Tuesday, and Google does their updates on Wednesday. They can either be time based (eg: Microsoft and Google) or feature-based (eg: videos being released for the core game and downloadable content (DLC) being released afterwards). 

There are many version control systems, such as Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control. We are using Git for the computing science program at Lillian Osborne. Git is the most commonly used system, although there are some that are similar.
