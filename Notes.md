### Version Control Systems 

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps **record changes** to files by keeping track of modifications done to the file. 

Version control systems provides a framework for *external documentation*, where each commit documents what changes were made from previous versions of code. In addition, it provides documentation, such as README files within the project folder. 

Version control contributes to *change management* as data is not lost when personnel leave the project and new recruits that are hired will have documentation about what has already happened.
